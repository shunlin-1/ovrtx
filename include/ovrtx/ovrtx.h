     * General notes
     * Return values:
     *   All operations return status of **OVRTX_API_SUCCESS** if the operation was enqueued successfully,
     *   **OVRTX_API_ERROR** if the operation failed to be enqueued or already failed to execute before
     *   the enqueue call returned.
     *   If an error is returned the error string is valid until the next API call from the current thread.
     *   Note that the error data lives in thread local storage so any operation that might trigger a fiber
     *   switch will also invalidate the error string.
     * Stream ordered asynchronous execution:
     *   All operations that are marked as asynchronous execute in a stream-ordered fashion.
     *   They might return handles that can be used in subsequent operations,
     *   but the actual objects or effects represented by those handles will not necessarily be produced
     *   when the enqueue function calls return.
     *   Stream synchronization events can be used to ensure stream execution for an enqueued function call and all prior calls
     *   have happened.
     *   Specifically a synchronization event ensures that input resources provided to previously enqueued operations
     *   will no longer be accessed after the synchronization event is signaled.
     *   Synchronization events can be device specific to allow ensuring that access to input resources on a certain device
     *   are completed before the synchronization event is signaled.
     *
     *   When a stream ordered operation is executed, the result of the operation will look as if all prior operations
     *   have been executed and completed serially. The underlying execution of operations might overlap, when the system
     *   determines that this will not affect the result of the operation.

    /**
     * Register ovrtx's USD schema/plugin discovery paths and lightweight USD/MDL
     * environment, without loading USD or initializing the renderer.
     *
     * This is intended for applications that share an OpenUSD runtime between multiple
     * subsystems (for example ovrtx and ovphysx). USD's schema registry and several
     * TfEnvSettings are populated only once for the process, so every subsystem that
     * contributes schema/plugin paths or USD-facing path environment must publish them
     * before the registry is first consulted (typically when the first stage is opened).
     * Each subsystem calls its own equivalent (e.g.
     * `ovphysx_prepare_usd_plugins()`, `ovrtx_register_schema_paths(...)`) before any of
     * them initialize, after which the order of initialize calls no longer matters.
     *
     * Binary package root resolution (highest precedence first):
     *  1. The `OMNI_USD_PLUGINS_BASE_PATH` environment variable, if set.
     *  2. `OVRTX_CONFIG_BINARY_PACKAGE_ROOT_PATH` from @p config, if @p config is non-null
     *     and contains that entry. The path may include @ref OVX_CONFIG_EXECUTABLE_DIR_TOKEN,
     *     which the loader substitutes with the absolute directory of the running executable.
     *  3. The directory of the loaded ovrtx loader library (default).
     *
     * @param config Optional configuration (may be NULL). When non-null, the
     *               `OVRTX_CONFIG_BINARY_PACKAGE_ROOT_PATH` entry, if present, anchors the
     *               bundled `usd_plugins/` tree. Pass the same config (or one with an
     *               equivalent `binary_package_root_path`) that you will subsequently
     *               supply to @ref ovrtx_initialize() / @ref ovrtx_create_renderer().
     *
     * Notes:
     * - Safe to call before @ref ovrtx_initialize() and before @ref ovrtx_create_renderer().
     * - Also publishes the same process environment that the ovrtx loader sets before
     *   loading ovrtx.dylib (Hydra/USD toggles, MDL search paths, MaterialX search
     *   paths, and resolver MDL-bypass env). If dev/test settings were queued via
     *   `OVRTX_EXTENSION_APPLY_SETTINGS`, only the path settings needed for this
     *   lightweight USD environment are consumed here.
     * - Idempotent for matching roots: the first call performs registration; subsequent
     *   calls with the same effective root are no-ops.
     * - **First-call wins.** Once schema/plugin paths have been registered against an
     *   effective binary package root, subsequent calls (here, or via @ref ovrtx_initialize() /
     *   @ref ovrtx_create_renderer()) that resolve to a different effective root log a
     *   warning to stderr and are no-ops; `PXR_PLUGINPATH_NAME` stays anchored at the
     *   first-registered root (the contract is one-shot per process, since USD's plug
     *   system reads it once during static initialization).
     * - Calling this after USD has already been loaded and the schema registry populated
     *   has no retroactive effect on previously-discovered schemas.
     * - This function does not allocate the ovrtx system, start Carbonite, load renderer
     *   plugins, or apply general Carb settings; it only adjusts process-global
     *   environment used by USD discovery and USD-facing MDL/MaterialX setup.
     *
     * @return Always **OVRTX_API_SUCCESS**. This API does not surface failure through
     *         the return code or @ref ovrtx_get_last_error(); a mismatched root logs a
     *         warning to stderr instead. (This is the one exception to the file-level
     *         return-value rule above.)

     * its lifetime is tied to ovrtx_initialize / ovrtx_shutdown, not to any
     * particular renderer instance. As a result the callback receives messages
     * emitted before the first ovrtx_create_renderer (framework startup, plugin
     * loading, the OVRTX logging banner) as well as messages emitted during and
     * after ovrtx_destroy_renderer (e.g. asset eviction during teardown).
     *

     * (no concurrent invocations).
     *
     * Channel filter syntax
     * ---------------------
     * @p channel_filter is a comma-separated list of `<channel_prefix>=<level>`
     * entries (RUST_LOG-style). The channel prefix is matched against carb's
     * dotted source name; longest matching prefix wins. Per-channel rules
     * override @p severity for matched channels. Channels not matched by any
     * rule use @p severity as their threshold. The empty / NULL filter is
     * equivalent to "every channel uses @p severity".
     *
     * Accepted level names (case-insensitive):
     *     "verbose" (alias "debug"), "info", "warn" (alias "warning"),
     *     "error", "fatal".
     *
     * Whitespace around tokens and trailing commas are tolerated; empty entries
     * are skipped. Malformed entries (missing `=`, unknown level name, empty
     * channel name) cause this function to return OVRTX_API_ERROR with a
     * descriptive ovrtx_get_last_error() string and leave the previously
     * installed callback state unchanged.
     *
     * Examples:
     *   - `""`                                     no rules; every channel uses @p severity
     *   - `"omni.usd=error"`                       omni.usd* uses error+, everything else uses @p severity
     *   - `"carb=warn,carb.tasking=verbose"`       carb.tasking uses verbose+, other carb.* uses warn+,
     *                                              everything else uses @p severity
     *
     * @param severity Default severity threshold applied to channels not
     *                 matched by an explicit rule in @p channel_filter. Use
     *                 OVRTX_LOG_INFO to receive INFO and above by default;
     *                 OVRTX_LOG_ERROR to filter out everything but errors by
     *                 default. Note that ovrtx_log_severity_t does not expose
     *                 carb's lower verbose / debug levels: those are dropped
     *                 by the default and can only be received by an explicit
     *                 per-channel rule like "carb.tasking=verbose" in @p
