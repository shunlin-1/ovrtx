Render Modes
============

Camera sensors in ovrtx support three render modes, each offering a different trade-off between image quality and performance. The render mode is set per RenderProduct using the ``omni:rtx:rendermode`` attribute.

   * - Mode
     - ``omni:rtx:rendermode``
     - Description
   * - Real-Time Path-Tracing
     - ``Real-Time Path-Tracing``
     - Full path-traced rendering with real-time denoising. Produces high-quality images with accurate global illumination, reflections, and shadows. This is the default mode and the best choice for most applications requiring visual fidelity.
   * - Path Tracing
     - ``PathTracing``
     - Progressive path tracing that accumulates samples over multiple frames for ground-truth-quality rendering. Best suited for offline or reference-quality workflows where convergence time is acceptable.
   * - Minimal
     - ``Minimal``
     - Lightweight rasterization-based rendering with minimal GPU cost. Use this when you need maximum throughput and do not require path-traced lighting -- for example, segmentation masks, bounding-box visualization, or high-FPS reinforcement learning loops.

Choosing a Mode
---------------

- **Default to Real-Time Path-Tracing** for sensor simulation, synthetic data generation, and any workflow that requires physically accurate lighting.
- Use **Path Tracing** when you need converged, reference-quality images and can afford to accumulate samples across frames.
- Use **Minimal** when rendering throughput matters more than visual quality -- for example, thousands of environments stepping in parallel for RL training.

Different RenderProducts in the same scene can use different render modes. For example, one camera could use ``Real-Time Path-Tracing`` for RGB output while another uses ``Minimal`` for fast segmentation.

Refer to :doc:`outputs` for the available outputs per render mode.
