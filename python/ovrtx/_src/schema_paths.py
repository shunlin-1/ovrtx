"""Thin Python wrapper around the C ``ovrtx_register_schema_paths`` API.

USD schema/plugin path registration is implemented in a single place:
``rendering/source/sharedlibs/ovrtx/CRenderApiLibLoader.cpp`` (the
``registerUsdPluginPathsBody`` / ``registerSchemaPathsIfNeeded`` pair). This
module loads the ovrtx loader shared library and calls the exported
``ovrtx_register_schema_paths`` C entry point, so the same code path runs
whether the registration originates from Python (auto-import hook in
``ovrtx/__init__.py``), from a C/C++ host's ``ovrtx_register_schema_paths``
call, or implicitly from ``ovrtx_initialize`` / ``ovrtx_create_renderer``.

This module previously duplicated the path-resolution and env-var-update
logic in pure Python. The duplicate has been removed because USD's plug
registry contract (one-shot per process during ``Plug_InitConfig``) made
keeping two implementations in sync error-prone — when the C side picked up
the renamed ``OV_PXR_PLUGINPATH_2511`` env-var via the ``OV_OPENUSD_PLUGINPATH``
build macro, the Python copy silently diverged and broke schema discovery
in co-load scenarios with peer subsystems (the OMPE-92973 follow-up bug).
A single source of truth in C avoids that class of drift entirely.

    Thin wrapper that loads ``ovrtx-dynamic`` and invokes the C-side
    :c:func:`ovrtx_register_schema_paths`. All path-resolution and env-var
    update logic lives in ``CRenderApiLibLoader.cpp`` so every entry point
    (Python auto-import hook, ``ovrtx_initialize``, ``ovrtx_create_renderer``,
    explicit ``ovrtx_register_schema_paths`` call from a C/C++ host) runs
    the same code.

    See ``ovrtx.h`` for the full contract — first-call wins, idempotent for
    matching effective roots, calls with a different root log a warning to
    stderr.

    Args:
        binary_package_root: Optional override for the ovrtx binary package
            root. Forwarded by setting ``OMNI_USD_PLUGINS_BASE_PATH`` (the
            highest-precedence input the C resolver consults), so this is
            equivalent to passing the same root in
            ``OVRTX_CONFIG_BINARY_PACKAGE_ROOT_PATH`` to a subsequent
            ``ovrtx_initialize`` / ``ovrtx_create_renderer``. When ``None``
            the C side resolves the root from ``OMNI_USD_PLUGINS_BASE_PATH``
            (if already set in the env) then from the loader's own location
            (``GetModuleFileName`` / ``dladdr``).

            .. note::
               Passing a non-``None`` value mutates ``OMNI_USD_PLUGINS_BASE_PATH``
               in the process env unconditionally — even on the second call,
               where the C side has already pinned the first-registered root
               and merely emits a stderr warning. The env-var mutation has no
               effect on USD's plug registry (one-shot per process), but it
               will be observed by anything that consults
               ``OMNI_USD_PLUGINS_BASE_PATH`` later. Pass the same root on
               every call (or ``None`` after the first) if you need the env
               to stay consistent with the registered root.

    Side effect on ``os.environ``: each call mirrors the post-C-call CRT
    value of every key in ``_PXR_PLUGINPATH_ENV_KEYS`` into ``os.environ``
    (overwriting any prior Python-side edits to those specific keys, by
    design — the CRT is the source of truth for what USD sees). See the
    inline comment below the C call for rationale and platform notes.
